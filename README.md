30-Day Readmission Risk Among Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy – Summary Report
This report summarizes an analysis of 1,024 female breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, with a focus on predicting and understanding 30-day hospital readmissions.

Using a simulated dataset modeled after SEER-Medicare characteristics, we trained a predictive model that achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.78, identifying key risk factors such as advanced age, comorbidities, poor performance status, and early dose reductions.

Our model stratified patients into risk tiers, where 100% of patients flagged as “High Risk” were indeed readmitted within 30 days. Febrile neutropenia and dehydration were the most common causes.

These findings highlight opportunities for proactive care strategies and monitoring for high-risk patients to reduce readmission burden and improve outcomes.
